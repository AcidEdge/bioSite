            <p class="link-text">Stillbrave was founded by Tom Mitchell, A.K.A. Tattoo Tom in memory of his dauger Shayla, who lost her battle to childhood cancer (Stage 4 Hodgkin's). Stillbrave's mission is to help support childhood cancer patients and their families in any way possible, like helping families pay basic bills such as rent or utilities and by being there, in person for kids undergoing treatment. Tattoo Tom has also made a name for himself by competing in ultra-marations in memory of those that have been diagnosed. Theses races are over 200 miles long, and he carries a picture of a childhood cancer victim for every mile of the race.
                 Most recently, in 2019 Tom completed the <a href="https://www.destinationtrailrun.com/bigfoot" target="_blank">Bigfoot 200</a>, a 200 mile race up an around Mt St Helen, and is currently training for the <a href="https://www.destinationtrailrun.com/moab" target="_blank">Moab 240</a>, a 240 mile race through the Moab Dessert later this year.</p>
