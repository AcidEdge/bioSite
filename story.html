                <p>Hailie was diagnosed with germinoma (a rare type of childhood brain cancer) a few months before her 10th birthday. The diagnosis included multiple MRI scans and a surgical biopsy. During her initial hospitalization, it took the team of doctors nearly 2 weeks to get her sodium stabilized and her endocrine system under control while they looked for the cause of her illness. Due to the endocrine issues she was facing, the doctors began looking at her pituitary gland (located in the brain, behind the optic nerves), and found that it was being crushed by the cancer. </p>
                <p>After nearly 5 weeks in the hospital, she was finally discharged with a diagnosis and a treatment plan. She would receive 4 rounds of inpatient chemotherapy, with 3 weeks between each round, followed by 30 days of radiotherapy to ensure a full recovery. As the treatment plan started, Hailie began to take a more active interest in those caring for her, always wanting to know more about the nursing field especially. During her second round of chemo she told her parents that she wanted to be a pediatric oncology nurse when she grew up, with a conviction that would rival many adults.</p>
                <p> As the treatment plan progressed, Hailie’s strength, courage and bravery only continued to grow. She became an inspiration to everyone that she interacted with, through her kind heart and fighting spirit. She was gifted a wig from an organization called Wigs-For-Kids but wore it only once. Instead, she preferred to go bald, saying “I don’t care what people think”. After almost 8 months of treatments, being poked and prodded, she was finally declared cancer-free. </p>
                <p>The video to the left was made by Hailie's father after her first battle, documenting her journey, fight and success. </p>

                <p>After fighting her battle, she continued her desire to care for others. Hailie always wanted to help if one of her siblings were sick, or offered to babysit any chance she could. Little did she know that this was only a calm between storms. A year and a half after completing her treatments, a routine MRI scan revealed that her cancer had returned. Although not as large and medically impactful as it was when she was first diagnosed, it baffled her doctors. This was the first case they had seen where her type of cancer had returned. The new treatment plan involved upping the game by increasing the strength of the chemotherapy, more radiation, and a bone marrow transplant as a side effect. Due to the strength of the chemo, it would end up destroying her bone marrow. Before treatment began she sat through the 12 hour long process of donating her own cells, which were frozen and held for after her chemo treatments.</p>
                <p>The chemo treatment and BMT (Bone Marrow Transplant) far surpassed the struggle she went through the first time around. A week straight of high strength chemo drugs multiple times a day, and only 3 days of rest before she was given her cells back to regrow her marrow. Recovery from this treatment took nearly 2 month in the hospital, with a little over half in the ICU. Due to the strength of the chemo, it also effected nearly every other organ and system in her body, a process that almost killed her multiple times. Throughout the recovery Hailie never once complained, holding her head high (at least when she had the strength to stay awake) and looking forward to being a nurse on the very floor she was treated on. </p>
                <p>Radiation only lasted for 10 days this time around, due to limitations on the amount of radiation any one area of the body can handle before causing more damage to the body. Still, after everything she went through, she kept her head up and made everyone around her smile. Once again she was cancer free.</p>

                <h2 style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Battle #3</h3>
                <p>At 14 and a half years old, she started high school. Due to ongoing conditions caused by the damaged pituitary, she would never physically grow past 10 years old, but that never stopped her. She had a way of interacting with others that left them in awe. Never timid, she openly told her story to anyone that would hear, with a strength and conviction that inspired courage in others. She had grownup so fast, was wise beyond her years, and never gave up. </p>
                <p>A few weeks after starting high school, Hailie began having trouble with her vision, and by November her sight was gone. After more scans and more testing, she was once again facing her worst nightmare, for a third time in 5 years. This time was different however, as there was increased pressure in her brain, which had a partial effect on her sight, along with the cancer now pushing on the optic nerves. She had a shunt placed to help relieve the pressure while her doctors looked desperately for options. </p>
                <p>Due to her previous history of treatments, Hailie’s options for her third fight were limited to experimental protocols. A genetic sequencing of her cancer revealed a marker very similarly found in adult breast cancer, which had a targeted treatment available. This treatment was added with another drug that was being tested for its ability to carry other medicines to the brain more effectively. The process of getting the treatments started however was very slow, while her cancer continued to grow and spread into the ventricles of the brain. </p>
                <p>The third battle with cancer finally broke her little spirit. After loosing her sight and having limited options, Hailie finally began talking about wanting to give up. After 6 years of fighting for her life she had reached her breaking point, a point which many others would have reached years before her. Even her nurses and doctors told her that she handled her battle better than most adults they had seen. Just days before her 16th birthday Hailie had a checkup and was admitted to the hospital due to dangerously low sodium levels, an issue which was completely unusual for her (she constantly fought against abnormally high levels). This low sodium cause her to go into something similar to a comatose state, unable to respond or move. She was aware of her surroundings and was able to squeeze her parents’ hands to answer questions, but often wouldn’t. Hailie spent nearly 2 months in that state, with doctors having no answers if she would recover. It became increasingly difficult for the medical team to keep her stabilized, and her parents made the decision no parent should ever have to make. The had the doctors stop all treatments, and she passed peacefully 2 days later, June 8, 2019 at 9:22 am. </p>
                <p>Although she is gone, her story continues to inspire others to this day through the courage and fighting spirit she clung to until she knew her time here was coming to a close. On the same day she passed, an administrator at her old elementary/middle school contacted her parents, wanting to set-up a special school award, only to find she had passed that morning. One week later, at the schools 8th grade graduation, the inaugural Hailie-Witt Perseverance Award was given to a student that had shown incredible courage and perseverance through their time at the school, presented by Hailie’s teachers and family. The award is given to one student every year to this day.</p>
