            <p>Hailie loved anything crafty, especially coloring. Every possible coloring book she had to have. Throughout her treatments she would receive gifts from the hospital as well, and quickly grew a large collection of coloring books, pages, and all manner of mediums. Her parent’s once claimed they’re surprised she didn’t have a large stake in Crayola with how many things she had. One of her favorites was purses and bags that we covered in a coloring book pattern, that came with markers where she could color in the design herself. Over the years she collected over 20 of them alone. During one of her treatment visits, she was given a set of markers and stencils designed to look like tattoo art. Her dad spent the next 2 days giving her a full sleeve marker tattoo. </p>

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Stuffed Animals</h1>
            <p>Hailie’s other passion (or obsession depending on viewpoint) was stuffed animals. She always had one with her during her battles. Normal adults have decorative pillows, Hailie covered her bed in stuffed bears. Even the top shelf of her closet was packed with her stuffed friends. </p>

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Spreading Joy</h1>
            <p>Above all else Hailie loved to share joy. She would make little notes or crafted gifts for her nurses. Her parents would often come home from work to a little note or picture, thanking them for helping her fight, saying how much she loved and appreciated them. She loved to share her light with anyone she could. It was her mission to make everyone smile. s</p>
