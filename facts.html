            <p>
                <ul class="facts">
                    <li>About 1 in 285 children will develop cancer before the age of 20. </li>
                    <li>46 children per day or 16,850 children per year are expected to be diagnosed in 2020 with cancer (11,050 ages 0 to 14, and 5,800 ages 15 to 19) </li>
                    <li>5,270 children under 20 years will be diagnosed with brain and other CNS Tumors.</li>
                    <li>The average age at diagnosis is 8 overall (ages 0 to 19), 5 years old for children (aged 0 to 14), and 17 years old for adolescents (aged 15 to 19) (9), while adults’ average age for cancer diagnosis is 65</li>
                    <li>Childhood cancer is not one disease – there are more than 12 major types of pediatric cancers and over 100 subtypes.</li>
                    <li>Most new cancer diagnoses in children are for leukemia (26.1%) brain/CNS cancers (17.2%), while brain/CNS cancers (21%) and lymphoma (20%) were top cancers for the adolescents.</li>
                    <li>12.5% of all newly diagnosed brain tumors occur under age 20.</li>
                </ul>

          <div class="right-div">
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Long Term Effects from Treatment</h2>
                <ul class="facts">
                    <li>More than 95% of childhood cancer survivors will have a significant health related issue by the time they are 45 years of age (2); these health-related issues are side-effects of either the cancer or more commonly, the result of its treatment. 1/3 will suffer severe and chronic side effects; 1/3rd will suffer moderate to severe health problems; and 1/3rd will suffer slight to moderate side effects.</li>
                    <li>Female childhood cancer survivors who were treated with chemotherapy— even if they did not receive radiation treatments to their chest — are six times more likely than the general population to be diagnosed with breast cancer later in life. For those who did receive chest radiation, that chance increases exponentially and is on par with those who have the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.</li>
                    <li>Childhood cancer survivors are at a 15-fold increased risk of developing Congestive Heart Failure and are at 7-fold higher risk of premature death due to cardiac causes, when compared with the general population.</li>
                    <li>ancer in children and young adults is different from cancer that develops later in life. Some of the unwanted side effects of cancer treatments cause more harm to children than they do to adults. This is because children’s bodies are still growing and developing, so cancer and its treatment are more likely to affect developing organs. </li>

          <div class="left-div">
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Survival</h2>
            <ul class="facts">
                <li>The average 5-year survival rate for childhood cancers when considered as a whole is 84%</li>
                <li>Survival rates can range from almost 0% for cancers such as DIPG, a type of brain cancer, to as high as 90% for the most common type of childhood cancer known as Acute Lymphoma Leukemia (ALL).</li>
                <li>In 2015 there were nearly 429,000 childhood cancer survivors in the United States. This number is projected to grow to more than 500,000 by 2020.</li>
                <li>Children who were treated for bone cancer, brain tumors, and Hodgkin lymphoma, or who received radiation to their chest, abdomen, or pelvis, have the highest risk of serious late effects from their cancer treatment, including second cancers, joint replacement, hearing loss, and congestive heart failure.</li>
                <li>Those that survive the five years have an eight times greater mortality rate due to the increased risk of liver and heart disease and increased risk for reoccurrence of the original cancer or of a secondary cancer.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="right-div">
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Loosing the Battle</h2>
            <ul class="facts">
                <li>On average, 7 children (ages 0-19) die from cancer every day, or 1 every 5 hours.</li>
                <li>Cancer is the number one cause of death by disease among children.</li>
                <li>On average, about 16% of children die within 5 years of diagnosis. Among those children who survive to five years from diagnosis, 18% of them will die over the next 25 years.</li>
                <li>Overall cancer death rates among children ages 0 to 14 years decreased an average of 1.4% per year. Among adolescents and young adults ages 15 to 39 years, overall cancer death rates decreased an average of 1.0% per year. </li>
                <li>There are 70 potential life years lost on average when a child dies of cancer compared to 15 potential life years lost for adults.</li>
                <li>Brain cancer represents 29.9% of total childhood cancer deaths while leukemia accounts for 24.9%</li>
                <li>A diagnosis of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is normally terminal with less than 25% of children surviving even two years.</li>
                <li>Worldwide, 100,000 children lose their lives every year to cancer.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="right-div">
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Research Funding</h2>
            <ul class="facts">
                <li>Unlike adult cancers, childhood cancer research only recieves 4% of the NIH (National Institute of Health) total budget, which has to be divided across all types of childhood cancer.</li>
                <li>Thanks to an increase of awareness and chapmioning of the cause, recent years have seen additional funding through congressional bills, such as the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act. Although more funding is needed.</li>
                <li>Childhood cancer research remains groesly underfunded and lacks the same kinds of advancments made with adult cancers in the last decades.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="left-div">
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Treatments Available</h2>
            <ul class="facts">
                <li>Many of the treatments used today are the same treatments from 30 years ago.</li>
                <li>While hundreds of cancer drugs have been developed and approved for adults, the FDA, through 2019 has approved a total of 34 drugs for use in the treatment of childhood cancers.</li>
                <li>Of those 34 approved cancer drugs, 30 were originally designed and approved only for adult use.</li>
                <li>Today we have only four drugs that were approved in the first instance for use in cancer treatment for children: Teniposide (1992 for ALL) use now discontinued by NCI, clofarabine (2004 for ALL), dinutuximab (2015 for NB), tisagenlecleucel (2017 for ALL) and calaspargase pegol-mk (2018 for ALL). </li>
